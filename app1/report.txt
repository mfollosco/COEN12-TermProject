Application 1

Function Runtimes:
-----------------
createDataSet: O(n)
destroyDataSet: O(n)
searchAge: O(1)
insert: O(1)
deletion: O(n)
maxAgeGap: O(1)

Approach:
--------
I chose a hash chaining approach. Technically I could have implemented
with an array since we were given the max number of students however I
found hashing to be more efficient, especially with lots of search
operations. A circularly linked list was helpful in traversal of the 
whole list.
