The goal of this project was to demonstrate my knowledge aquired over 10 weeks of my Data Structures and algorithims class. In this project I: 
1) chose and implemented the most efficient data stucture for the specific scenatio (specified in project outlines)
2) leveraged dynamic memory allocation for a reduced memory footprint
3) analyzed and optimized algorithims for performance 

Skill outcomes:
  1) demonstrated proficiency in C
  2) demonstrated use of navigating within terminal

This project was the most challenging because it involved little guidance from TA's and allowed more freedom in my individual approach to solving the problem.
